## Trireme WAR Sample

This sample shows how to use the trireme-servlet module to create a WAR.

To test it, build this module and deploy the ".war" file from the "target" directory to your app server.
The resulting servlet will have an static HTML "index" page that lets you make a few calls into Node.js.

For more information on how to run Trireme as a servlet, see the [trireme-servlet](../../servlet/README.md) module.
